I"<p>EPEXA is an NSF-supported R&amp;D project that will create a
        production-quality, general-purpose, community-supported, open-source
        software ecosystem that attacks the twin challenges of programmer
        productivity and portable performance for advanced scientific
        applications on modern high-performance computers. Of special interest
        are irregular and sparse applications that are poorly served by current
        programming and execution models.</p>

<p>The project addresses central challenges from modern computational
        science:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advances in predictive, high-fidelity simulation are characterized by
        increasingly irregular and dynamic computation (block sparse,
        low-rank, mixed representations, etc.).</li>
  <li>Ongoing technology trend in heterogeneous architectures with
        dynamically changing performance, and the need to increase concurrency
        at all scales.</li>
</ul>

<p>EPEXA builds upon prior work performed by the TESSE (Task-based
        Environment for Scientific Simulation at Extreme Scale) project, and in
        particular aims to complete the design and provide robust implementation
        of TESSEâ€™s main C++ API, the Template Task Graph (<a href="ttg/">TTG</a>) that provides a
        powerful data-flow programming model. Specific project aims include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To extend, complete, and harden the successful TESSE research
        prototype providing its first production quality implementation using
        a community-based, science-driven approach.</li>
  <li>To grow and support the user community, associated applications, and
        research use cases.</li>
  <li>To create a community to design, maintain, support and to grow EPEXA
        in the future.</li>
  <li>To transform the scalability of key parts of new and existing
        numerical simulation codes, including enabling the development of new
        DSLs by utilizing the API of the EPEXA runtime, and by migration paths
        for both applications and application programmers to follow.</li>
</ul>
